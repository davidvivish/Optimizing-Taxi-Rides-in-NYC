# **Final Project: Optimizing Shared Taxi Rides in New York City**
This project was conducted by a group of students from CEOR E4011: Infrastructure Systems Optimization at Columbia University.

## **Overview**
This project analyzes taxi trip data to optimize shared taxi rides in New York City. By exploring temporal and geographical patterns, the study leverages integer programming and optimization techniques to identify opportunities for pairing taxi trips. The goal is to reduce traffic congestion and promote environmental sustainability in urban transportation.

## **Objectives**
1. Analyze taxi trip data to uncover patterns in demand, including peak hours and high-demand areas.
2. Implement an integer programming model to optimize trip sharing.
3. Evaluate the impact of varying constraints on trip-sharing potential, such as time intervals and pickup/dropoff distances.

## **Key Features**
1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Visualized hourly trip distribution and fare earnings.
   - Explored geographical pickup and dropoff clustering.
   - Analyzed passenger count distribution to identify sharing potential.

2. **Optimization Model**:
   - Used integer programming to maximize the number of shared taxi trips.
   - Incorporated constraints such as maximum pickup/dropoff distances and time intervals.

3. **Results**:
   - Demonstrated how increased flexibility in constraints leads to more shared rides.
   - Identified key routes and times with the highest potential for sharing.

## **Data Sources**
- **Taxi Trip Data**: Dataset for green taxis in NYC (January 19, 2016).
  - Includes pickup/dropoff locations, passenger counts, and timestamps.
